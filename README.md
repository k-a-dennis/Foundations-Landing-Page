# Foundations-Landing-Page
Landing page project to wrap the HTML/CSS/Flexbox Foundations modules

Pseudocode:
Body: flexbox
Hero div
    *I think... keep body BG color for header+footer*
    >Nested div "header" for top row logo+links
        Separate divs for "left links" and "right links
            ul for the three right links
    >Nested div for main text+subtext+sign up button+image
        Nested div for main text
            Nested div for secondary text
            Nested div for button
        Nested div for an <a> element (for image)
Body div
    Nested div for (rounded edge) boxes
        Each box is an 'info' div maybe?
    Nested div for quote section
    Nested div for call to action button
        Nest button inside
Footer div
